# specific asset handling, compression, site logging
# by default, caching should be handled in 'location /', and should instruct not to cache

# priority, from most to least:
# 1. location = (exact path)
# 2. location ^~ (path starts with)
# 3. location ~ (case-sensitive) OR location ~* (case-insensitive) regex
# 4. location

# NOTE: When querying NGINX from a different reverse proxy, response headers can only be added via 'location' directives. They will otherwise be ignored.
# See https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/ , section 3.5 for exact examples of which files need a CSP resource.
